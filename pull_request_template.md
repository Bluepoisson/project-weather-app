My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
It was a tough nut to crack. Glad I did turn the project in, although delayed. Merely made the basic requests.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
I'm still confused around functions, their structure and when to create them.
Also how to structure my code, in this case f.ex all variables , functions and fetches grouped together, as opposed to in the scope of each fetch, as I have done
