# Weather App

Create a weather app containing current weather for wanted city and a 5 days forecast.

## The problem

Learning how to fetch an api and displaying wanted data was quite simple until I encountered an array and had to format time and dates. My knowledge was base being far too slim combined with my stubborness made me loose valuable time.
Focused on getting the body of the code done for a late hand in of the assignement.
